🇦🇪 UAE WiFi Captive‑Portal URL List
A curated collection of URLs used for detecting and logging‑in to captive portals on Wi‑Fi networks across the United Arab Emirates.

📖 Overview
Many public Wi‑Fi hotspots in the UAE redirect users to a captive‑portal page before granting internet access.
This repository gathers the most commonly observed detection and login URLs that devices (or scripts) can probe to determine whether a captive portal is present and, if so, where to send authentication credentials. Also useful to bypass DNS resolution with yout authenticated/Enrypted dns services.

⚠️ Note:
All URLs were obtained through personal testing. Their availability is not guaranteed—some may stop working, change, or be blocked in certain locations. Use them at your own risk. The author assumes no liability for any issues arising from their use.
